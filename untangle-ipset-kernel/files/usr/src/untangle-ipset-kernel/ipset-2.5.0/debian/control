Description: administration tool for kernel IP sets
 IP sets are a framework inside the Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x kernel which can be
 administered by the ipset(8) utility. Depending on the type, an IP set may
 store IPv4 addresses, TCP/UDP port numbers, or IPv4 addresses with MAC
 addresses in a way which ensures lightning speed when matching an entry
 against a set.
 .
 If you want to
 .
  * store multiple IPv4 addresses or port numbers and match against the entire
  collection using a single iptables rule;
 .
  * dynamically update iptables rules against IPv4 addresses or ports without
  performance penalty;
 .
  * express complex IPv4 address and ports based rulesets with a single iptables
  rule and benefit from the speed of IP sets;
 .
 then IP sets may be the proper tool for you.
