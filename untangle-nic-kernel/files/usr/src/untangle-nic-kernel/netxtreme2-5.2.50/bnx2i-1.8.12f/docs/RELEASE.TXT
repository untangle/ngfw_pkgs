Version 1.8.12f (Jan 19, 2010)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00044986 - LinuxiSCSI:Unable to get more than a few disks
		when i login to Netapp setup with maxlun disks
       Cause:   In certain configurations kernel is assigning 'shost->max_lun'
		a value of '8'. In most configurations is correctly assigned
		'512'
       Change:  Explicitly initialized shost->max_lun to '512' when a new
		scsi host is allocated and initialized
       Impact:  All chips, RHEL5.4 Linux distro

  Enhancements
  ============
	None

Version 1.8.12e (Dec 11, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
       None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Per OEM request made system log entry more administrator friendly
	e.g.  Changed
		"bnx2i: hba ffff810089abdcef does not support iscsi"
				to
		"bnx2i: dev eth0 does not support iscsi"

	README.TXT was updated to reflect this change.


Version 1.8.12d (Dec 09, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00044503: RHEL 5.4 x86_64 with Multiple iSCSI Errors
		Booting the Kernel
       Cause:   out-of-tree bnx2i was including references to symbols in
		scsi_transport_iscsi1 where as iscsi_tcp was referencing the
		ones in scsi_transport_iscsi2. This conflict caused software
		and offload iscsi not to coexist 
       Change:  Modified bnx2i driver to work with scsi_transport_iscsi2.
		Update session/connection/endpoint setup/teardown code path
		to account for new data structure objects created in libiscsi2
		which were not present in libiscsi1
       Impact:  All chips, RHEL5.4 Linux distro

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.8.12c (Dec 01, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00041327: Linux: Need Ability to Identify Adapter
		iSCSI Offload Capabilities
       Cause:   OEM's requested this feature because the driver was
		registering all NX2 devices with the iscsi transport layer.
       Change:  Modified bnx2i to register only the licensed devices with
		iscsi transport layer. This will avoid the need for mechanism
		to identify licensed and unlicensed NX2 devices as only the
		licensed devices will appear in '/sys/class/iscsi_transport'
		directory.
       Impact:  All chips, All Linux distro

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.8.12b (Nov 09, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Async logout with Equallogic target results in
		"CONN_DISCON" and "CONN_CLEANUP" timeout messages
       Cause:   This issue was initially reported by Vmware against
		ESX4.5 iSCSI inbox driver. This same issue was reproduced
		in Linux as well. Driver was returning DID_NO_CONNECT when
		the session is being logging out which caused a ton of debug
		log from SCSI-ML. While running heavy I/O on 12 session per
		port and simultaneously issue async message to logout these
		sessions caused a huge log spew which caused 570x device
		interrupt to be delayed in order of 10x seconds.
       Change:  Return DID_HOST_BUSY while session is being logged out and
		till either session recovers or recovery times out. Once
		session recovery timeout is hit driver will return
		DID_NO_CONNECT
       Impact:  All chips, All Linux distro

Version 1.8.12a (Oct 22, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Repacking 1.8.9u as baseline for T5.2 release


Version 1.8.9u (Oct 16, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00044141 - Linux iSCSI: Kernel panic while performing
		cable pull test with MPIO on RHEL5.4 (swiotlb_map_sg+0x2f/0x14a)
       Cause:   swiotlb_map_sg() crash was caused because SCSI-ML queued a
		command with sg_length = 0, sg_count = 1 and sg table != NULL.
		Driver was only looking at last 2 parameters to call pci_map_sg()
		or not. Follow on issue was cause by open-iscsi daemon changes,
		ep_disconnect() was called without calling stop_conn().
       Change:  Fixed driver to consider 'sg_length' before mapping SG buffers &
		also shost workqueue is flushed in ep_disconnect() if it is not
		already done so.
       Impact:  All chips on RHEL5.4

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.8.9t (Oct 08, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Special sections were added to list know issues and workarounds related
	to out-of-tree bnx2i and software iscsi coexistence issue in RHEL5.4


Version 1.8.9s (Sept 30, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00043901 - Linux iSCSI: RHEL5.4 OOB - Kernel panic
		during logout with iscsi-initiator-utils-6.2.0.871-0.10c 
       Cause:   Latest open-iscsi changed graceful session tear down sequence.
		ep_disconnect() is called before stop_conn() and this caused
		NULL pointer access while dereferencing conn->ep
       Change:  check for 'conn->ep' validity before dereferencing
       Impact:  All chipsets, RHEL5.4 only

    2. Problem: Cont00043896 - Linux iSCSI: System crash with
		iscsi-initiator-utils-6.2.0.871-0.10c
       Cause:   Duplicate of CQ43901. Please check CQ43901 for root cause
       Change:  Same as CQ43901
       Impact:  All chipsets, RHEL5.4 only


  Enhancements
  ============
    1. Problem: Cont00041327 - Linux: Need Ability to Identify Adapter
		iSCSI Offload Capabilities 
       Cause:   Refined fix which caused unlicensed device not to be
		unregister with iscsi transport. This is a partial fix and
		needs interface to be up before bnx2i loads.
		Complete fix will be delivered in T5.2
       Change:  Check for cnic_dev->mac_iscsi_conn while the device is
		registered as this value will be cleared during
		unregister_device() call
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux


Version 1.8.9r (Sept 27, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00041327 - Linux: Need Ability to Identify Adapter
		iSCSI Offload Capabilities 
       Cause:   bnx2i cannot determine license information unless the
		device is registered with cnic and the network port is
		initialized by the user (ifup). Because of limitation,
		driver was registering transport name for all enumerated
		NX2 devices
       Change:  Driver will continue to register all devices at init time
		and unregister the transport name when license information
		is available and found the device is not licensed for iSCSI.
		This eliminates the need for a separate means to identify if
		device support iSCSI or not.
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux

  Enhancements
  ============
     None


Version 1.8.9q (Aug 31, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00043282 - linux:iscsi_offload:can not modporbe bnx2i after
		installation of linux-nx2 v5.2.6 on RH 5.4 
       Cause:   RHEL5.4 has 2 sets of scsi_transport_iscsi and libiscsi modules,
		second modules added specifically to support inbox bnx2i. With 
		the current service load order, scsi_transport_iscsi2 gets
		loaded before bnx2id service is started. Initially bnx2id was
		chosen to be loaded after network service is started because of
		dependency of bnx2/bnx2x. Now that cnic driver implements weak
		symbol linking with bnx2/bnx2x, we can load cnic, bnx2i modules
		(start bnx2id service) much before network service
       Change:  start bnx2id service before iscsi/iscsid services
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux

  Enhancements
  ============
     None


Version 1.8.9p (Aug 17, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Updated README.TXT to reflect new combined packaging. nextreme2-<version>
     and ported a bug fix related to doorbell register mapping in IA64 architecture


Version 1.8.9o (Jul 25, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00042502 - Linux iSCSI HBA: SUT kernel panics after test
		I/O is started
       Cause:   MPP driver failed to honor bnx2i's 'sg_tablesize' and
		'max_sectors' parameter causing bnx2i to overstep BD table memory.
       Change:  Workaround is to allocate 4KB of memory for each BD table, i.e.
		255 entries per table which is sufficient to handle a maximum
		IO size of 512KB issued by MPP
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux

  Enhancements
  ============
	Above change will cause bnx2i to consume little more memory than previous
	drivers


Version 1.8.9n (Jul 22, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00042555 - Kernel panic occurs while running iLab iSCSI
		automated test 6.4 (data digest error)
       Cause:   Some tests used to hang because session recovery code never
		returned from wait due to sess->recovery_state mis-match
       Change:  Fixed wait state variable to check for sess->recovery_state = 0,
		which is cleared when session is re-logged in
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux, ESX

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.8.9m (Jul 01, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Updated Makefile in order to package bnx2i, bnx2, bnx2x and cnic together


Version 1.8.9l (June 30, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====

    1. Problem: DMA memory leak and eventualy run out of memory during
		overnight test
       Cause:   wrong 'size' parameter is sent to pci_free_consistent()
       Change:  pass 'dma->size' instead of PAGE_SIZE as 2nd argument to
		pci_free_consistent()
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux, ESX

    2. Problem: Linux iSCSI: Soft lockup seen while continuously restarting
		iscsid service overnight with persistent targets attached
		(bnx2i_conn_stop+0xc8/0x109)
       Cause:   login resources allocation failure was not handled correctly
		in create_conn() which caused timer_del_sync() to be called
		on an uninitialized timer in destroy_conn() path.
       Change:  fixed code to handle return value of
		bnx2i_conn_alloc_login_resources() and also added a flags to
		track if conn->poll_timer is initialized or not.
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux, ESX

    3. Problem: Everest1.0:Linux iSCSI:CX4 - kernel panic while running IPv6
		login/logout maxsessions stress(bnx2i_cm_remote_abort+0x23/0x41)
       Cause:   open-iscsi does conn_stop()/conn_destoy()/ep_disconnect()/
		sess_destroy() in the same order. So if remote RST/FIN is
		received after conn_destoy() will cause panic because driver
		will try to access ep->conn->worker_enabled and ep->conn is
		already set to NULL in conn_destoy(). We found the same issue
		on another test bed last evening
       Change:  Check ep->conn in cnic upcalls for remote RST/FIN and do not
		start session recovery if 'ep->conn' is NULL. Also take sess->lock
		to synchronize remote RST/FIN and conn_destroy() accessing ep->conn
       Impact:  All chipsets

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.8.9k (June 02, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====

    1. Problem: Cont00041700 - iSCSI Linux Offload:Everest:
		rmmod bnx2x or bnx2 causes system to hang
       Cause:   hba_poll_timer is only valid for ESX
       Change:  ifdef code valid only for ESX
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.8.9j (May 30, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====

    1. Problem: Cont00041556 - Linux iSCSI: Kernel panic during target logout
       Cause:   ESX change caused this issue. Method to get session pointer from
		iscsi_transport layer sess pointer is different for Linux and
		ESX, With recent changes Linux code was trying to get
		the sess pointer the ESX way
       Change:  Fix the above logic
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux, ESX

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.8.9i (May 26, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====

    1. Problem: Cont00039906 - Linux iSCSI: Soft lockup seen when performing
		adapter selftest with more than 10+ sessions connected
       Cause:   bnx2i was taking spinlock before calling cnic->register_device()
		and cnic would call bnx2i_start() in the same context which
		actually will sleep waiting for ISCSI_INIT response
       Change:  Fix is not to hold spinlock for the duration of register_device()
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux, ESX

    2. Problem: Cont00041210 - Everest1.0:Linux iSCSI:CX4 - kernel panic while
		running heavy disk traffic with bnx2i v1.8.7
		(bnx2i_conn_main_worker+0x10b/0x70a)
       Cause:   There were several bug fixes to workqueue/tasklet in last week
		and this panic dump is addressed by it
       Change:  Changes made to support tasklet implementation for ESX broke
		some of the logic. Cleaned up a bunch of issues related to this
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux, ESX

  Enhancements
  ============
	More stable ESX code with tasklet implementation and enhanced
  task management code. Build 00005 is based on this code. Some of the
  tasklet and workqueue bug fixes are applicable to both ESX and Linux


Version 1.8.7 (May 13, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Various driver crashes in error recovery path
       Cause:   tasklet/workqueue are scheduled when connection
		is in stopped state.
       Change:  Not to accept any commands if conn_stop() is called on
		the connection and this will eliminate any tasklet/workqueue
		scheduling. This was initially reported and more often seen
		in ESX, but same problem exhists in Linux as well
       Impact:  All chipsets, Linux, ESX

  Enhancements
  ============
	Further enhancements to tasklet/workqueue code


Version 1.8.6 (May 11, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00040971 - iSCSI Boot Linux Offload:NX2: compile error
		with bnx2i v1.8.5 on SuSE 10 SP2
       Cause:   In order to support older kernel iscsi_compat.h defines some
		functions which should have been defined 'static' but are not.
		This creates trouble when scsi_transport_iscsi.h is included in
		multiple *.c files.
       Change:  worked around iscsi_compat.h header file issues
       Impact:  All chipsets, SLES10 SP2

    2. Problem: Cont00040921 - ESX4.0 build 4.0.0-00000_x86_64 w/ bnx2i -
		iscsi_cmd_win_closed
       Cause:   not conforming to rfc1982
       Change:  Fixed serial arithmetic logic as per rfc1982
       Impact:  ALL chipsets, Linux, ESX

    3. Problem: Cont00040512 - ESX4.0 build 4.0.0-00000_x86_64 w/ bnx2i -
		Disks disappear after overnight stress tests
       Cause:   tasklet was being scheduled without being enabled when connections
		goes into recovery mode
       Change:  Tasklet is disabled in stop_conn() and enabled in bind_conn()
       Impact:  All chips + ESX40U1

    4. Problem: Cont00040920 - ESX4.0 build 4.0.0-00001_x86_64 w/ bnx2i -
		bnx2i_process_new_cqes+0x7b
       Cause:   This issues is seen only in workqueue implementation for ESX as
		scsi_host workqueue was not flushed fearing it would affect
		other connections. But would cause work to be scheduled after
		connection is torn down or in middle of recovery process
       Change:  per connection tasklet implementation will not exhibit this
		failure as tasklet is disable in conn_stop() and re-enabled in
		conn_bind()
       Impact:  All chipsets, ESX40U1

    5. Problem: Cont00040918 - ESX4.0 betabuild 4.0.0-00001_x86_64 w/ bnx2i
       Cause:   Duplidate of Cont00040920, please refer to Cont00040920 for
		more details
       Change:  Duplidate of Cont00040920, please refer to Cont00040920 for
		more details
       Impact:  All chipsets, ESX40U1

  Enhancements
  ============
	ESX40U1 driver changes to use tasklet instead of workqueue for command
  transmission and CQE processing.


Version 1.8.5 (Apr 29, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	ESX40U1 driver changes to match the updated iscsi_net API's


Version 1.8.4 (Apr 29, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Connection setup problems with 570x
       Cause:   Changes to 570X_SQE_DEFAULT macro caused alternate connections
		to fail
       Change:  reverted back 570X_SQE_DEFAULT to 128
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709

  Enhancements
  ============
	Performance improvements mentioned above


Version 1.8.3 (Apr 26, 2009)
Version 1.8.2 (Apr 25, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Vmware ESX40U1 driver updates


Version 1.8.1 (Apr 25, 2009)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00040099 - Linux iSCSI T4.6+ 57710 performance bottleneck
		at 80K IOps (L2 and Offload)
       Cause:   CQE processing in softIRQ context was becoming bottleneck because
		5771x has only on MSI-X vector for iSCSI completion notification.
		This caused 1 core to be pegged 100% processing completions.
       Change:  Implemented a per connection workqueue to process both command
		request and completion. This spreads work load to across available
		cores and boosted IOPS numbers to nearly at par with what should be
       Impact:  57710/5771/57711E

  Enhancements
  ============
	Performance improvements mentioned above


Version 1.8.0 (Apr 22, 2009)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00040267: Linux iSCSI: Kernel panic during cable pull
		with one iSCSI over native TCP connection + iSCSI offloaded
		connection
       Cause:   iscsi daemon is calling iscsi_transport->ep_poll() with
		ep_handle=0xffffffff eventhough driver failed ep_connect()
		request. This causes ep_poll() to access invalid memory and
		cause the crash
       Change:  Add additional check to ignore both ep_handle = 0xffffffff and
		null pointer
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710/5771/57711E

  Enhancements
  ============
	changed pci dma memory management code to be more stream lined


Version 1.7.0 (Mar 17, 2009)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00039999 - Linux iSCSI: Usages count increases for bnx2x
		when iSCSI sessions are connected via Teton/Xinan devices
       Cause:   Before looking up the route to target IP, there is a requirement
		that bnx2i has to register with cnic all active devices. cnic
		won't identify the device if the device is not registered.
		So when the first connection is offloaded, bnx2/bnx2x module
		usage count will be incremented once for every corresponding
		NX2 device in the system even though connection is offloaded on
		only one. This usage counts will be later decrement to zero when
		the last connection is torn down.
       Change:  Fix is the unregister all idle devices before returning from
		ep_connect()
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710/5771/57711E

    2. Problem: Cont00040037 - Linux iSCSI: Need jumbo frame support for
		Linux iSCSI offload in T5.0
       Cause:   bnx2i was checking and not allowing connection offload is device's
		MTU is set to > 1500
       Change:  changed maximum MTU limit to 9000B
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710/5771/57711E

    3. Problem: Cont00039906 - Linux iSCSI: Soft lockup seen when performing
		adapter selftest with more than 10+ sessions connected
       Cause:   Multiple problem caused this issue - big connection teardown/
		cleanup timeout in bnx2i and bnx2 was swutching off interrupts
		before propogating stop() call to ULPs
       Change:  bnx2 driver code was reordered to keep interrupts enabled during
		ULP's stop() call and bnx2i driver timeouts are tuned based on
		device type
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709

    4. Problem: Cont00039648 - Linux iSCSI: Please add line in README.TXT that
		states ipv6.ko is a requirement for cnic to load
       Cause:   Documentation enhancement request
       Change:  updated README.TXT to reflect the dependency requirements
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.6.2 (Mar 10, 2009)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00039912 - Linux iSCSI accel - unable to offload on NC532i,
		says iSCSI not supported
       Cause:   mismatch in PCI Id definition between system include and driver
		source
       Change:  fixed the mismatch
       Impact:  57711/57711E

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.6.1 (Feb 23, 2009)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Performance on 5606/5708 is sluggish & session keeps recovering
       Cause:   5706/5708 firmware can only handle 172 CQ entries and Everest
		requirements of SQ/CQ to be integral number of pages was causing
		this issue and 570x family has no such requirements
       Change:  Execute SQ/CQ size massaging code for 5771X device type only
       Impact:  5706/5708

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.6.0 (Jan 14, 2009)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00038728 - Linux iSCSI:Everest:A1: iscsiadm becomes
		unresponsive if wrong transport name is used
       Cause:   There was a list corruption in open-iscsi daemon code caused
		when list element is blindly initialized when it is actually
		a node in the pend_list. Also conn->link was not initialized
		when bind_conn() failed which caused crash in destroy_conn()
		code path.
       Change:  Fixed both open-iscsi user daemon and driver issues
       Impact:  57710/57711E

  Enhancements
  ============
	Updated copyright information


Version 1.4.9 (Jan 03, 2009)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: CQ38744 - Everest1.5:Linux iSCSI:CX4 - Unable to connect
		to more than ~450 sessions, out of host memory
       Cause:   Linux kernel can only address 1G memory which includes
		all kernel code and data structures. This limitation would
		not allow us to offload 1024 iscsi connections
       Change:  Limit number of outstanding tasks (SQ size) per connections
		to 64
       Impact:  57711E

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.4.8 (Dec 31, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: CQ38744 - Everest1.5:Linux iSCSI:CX4 - Unable to connect
		to more than ~450 sessions, out of host memory
       Note:    This is 1 of 3 fixes made to support 1024 connections.
		Refer to bnx2i-1.4.7 & netxtreme2-1.8.2c_1.48.7 release notes
		for other changes
       Cause:   992 connections limitation was due to limit on max numbers of
		file descriptors 'bnx2id' application was allowed to open.
		Default value is 1024, so bnx2id was able to allocate 1023
		socket structures and last 31 were not even delivered because
		the daemon was unable to open char device to issue ioctl.
		So driver ended up with only 992 tcp ports.
       Change:  Modified application to change RLIMIT_NOFILE parameter to 1056.
		With this change we were able to successfully open 1024 connections
		using 57711E device on a x86_64 system
       Impact:  57711E

  Enhancements
  ============
	Updated rc script to create '/dev/bnx2i' node during startup


Version 1.4.7 (Dec 29, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Unable to allocate endpoint structure for 513th connection
       Cause:   Driver was allocating a total of 512 endpoint structures due
		to a macro definition
       Change:  defined ISCSI_MAX_ADAPTERS to 8
       Impact:  57711E

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.4.6 (Dec 22, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00038965 - Everest1.5:Linux iSCSI:CX4 MF- bnx2i cid
		TCP errors while running iSCSI + netperf stress traffic
       Cause:   queuecommand() would report device offine when
		sess->lead_conn->ep is NULL. But actually this value will
		be NULL between the time existing endpoint (EP) is cleaned and
		a new endpoint is bound in bind_conn() call. This is a valid
		transient state during connection recovery and driver is
		suppose to report BUSY and not NO_CONNECT
       Change:  reverted back to old scheme
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710/57711

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.4.5 (Dec 17, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Driver crash when interface IP address is changed while
		there are actice connection
       Cause:   spinlock contention
       Change:  fixed spinlock contention
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710/57711

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.4.4 (Dec 11, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00038936 - LinuxiSCSI: bnx2x Firmware crash dump when
		loging out of EMC target
       Cause:   Incorrect handling of TCP CONNECT failure caused iscsid to
		behave improperly with follow on connections, ep_disconnect()
		was getting called just 1-sec after ep_connect(). According to
		implementation it should wait 15-secs before timing out,
		while firmware times out in 9-secs (3 attempts at 3-sec
		interval). So driver doesn't expect ep_disconnect() to be called
		before 10-secs after ep_connect() returns
       Change:  Fixed handling of TCP CONNECT failure in driver which avoids
		'iscsid' to get into weird state. Also even though ep_disconnect()
		is called immediately, driver will wait for firmware to complete
		TCP_CONNECT request with either good or failed status before going
		ahead with connection cleanup
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710/57711

    2. Problem: Cont00038965 - Everest1.5:Linux iSCSI:CX4 MF- bnx2i cid
		TCP errors while running iSCSI + netperf stress traffic
       Cause:   Recently changed queuecommand() to report device office
		if session is not in FFP stage. Actually we have to report
		device offline only after session recovery timeout (120-secs)
		is reached
       Change:  reverted back to old scheme
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710/57711

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.4.3 (Dec 09, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00038871 - Everest1.5:Linux iSCSI:CX4 MF-
		CONN_DISCON timeout + bnx2x driver assert during cable pull test
       Cause:   Due to open-iscsi interface change, NOOP OUT was not working as
		expected. open-iscsi user stack added following connection
		params to determine if NOOP is supported in user daemon or
		the kernel driver -
   		    1. ISCSI_PARAM_PING_TMO
   		    2. ISCSI_PARAM_RECV_TMO
   		As bnx2i depends on iscsid to implement this feature, it should
		return -ENOSYS to set_param() call to update above said parameters.
       Change:  After implementing this change, iSCSI NOOP OUT started to behave
		as expected.
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710/57711

    2. Problem: Cont00038797 - LinuxiSCSI:Segmentation fault when running
		ifup/down and passing traffic
       Cause:   Partly caused by NOOP OUT issue explained above (Cont00038871)
		and other issue was not guarding 'active_sess' list while
		traversing in bnx2i_start_hba_shutdown() routine & not
		properly handling in-recovery state in TMF code path
       Change:  Fixed above said conditions
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710/57711

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.4.2 (Dec 03, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Everest1.5:Linux iSCSI:CX4 - bnx2x driver assert while changing
		MTU size with targets connected
       Cause:   Issue was cause by mutex lock deadlock condition in
		cnic when unregister_device() is called while bnx2i is still in
		cnic_stop() function call processing.
       Change:  This issue is worked around in bnx2i by deferring inactive device
		unregistering till all the connections are torn down
       Impact:  57711

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.4.1 (Nov 17, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00038537 - Everest 1.5E MF-Linux iSCSI:
		Unable to iSCSI login to target
       Cause:   bnx2i was requesting a large number of TCP ports
		than bnx2id can allocate.
       Change:  bnx2i is changed to request 32 TCP ports at a time.
		Eventually bnx2id will be fixed to handle socket()/bind()
		call failure
       Impact:  57711

  Enhancements
  ============
	Added support for 57711


Version 1.4.0 (Nov 14, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Added support for 57711


Version 1.3.11 (Nov 12, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00038195 - LinuxiSCSI:Bnx2x kernel panic when running
		read/write test or when the target became unaccessible
       Cause:   There was a possibilty driver will unregister with cnic before
		all the connections are cleaned up. For such connection only
		driver resources are freed in ep_disconnect(). Driver assumes
		chip will be reset when ifdown request is completed and this
		is true for 5706/5708/5709. However in case of 57710 certain
		blocks such as CFC/SEARCHER will not be reset if second port
		is up. 
       Change:  So driver will have to wait for all connections to cleanup
		before returning from NETDEV_GOING_DOWN notification. Also 
		driver will block scsi host before entering clean mode to
		avoid any futher scsi command being queued with the driver
       Impact:  57710

    2. Problem: Cont00038030 - LinuxiSCSI: Data corruption writing to iscsi
		target
       Cause:   In Couple of scenarios driver was accessing memory immediately
		after freeing. Also in wrong memory was cleared because of wrong
		array index (control bits of ITT was not cleared in case of
		aborted commands. This would cause when a write command is aborted)
       Change:  Rearranged memory resources freeing and cleaned ITT table indexing
		code
       Impact:  57710

  Enhancements
  ============
	Enforce max SQ size of 128 for 5706/5708/5709 devices and also adjust
	to power of 2.


Version 1.3.10 (Oct 28, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Update RPM dependency in bnx2i.spec file from NetXtremeII to netxtrem2


Version 1.3.9 (Oct 28, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Fixed a race condition causing kernel dump when a netdev/inet event
	is received while session is being torn down. Durning iscsi session
	tear down process, open-iscsi stack will execute tasks in following
	order - 
	  1) iscsi logout
	  2) destroy iscsi connection
	  3) tear down endpoint (TCP connection)
	  4. destroy iscsi session

	This issue will manifest when a netdev/inet event is received b/w
	#2 and #4


Version 1.3.8 (Oct 26, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Updated RPM spec file to reflect module dependency to NetXtemeII
	instead of bnx2/bnx2x


Version 1.3.6 (Oct 16, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00037814 - Linux iSCSI:Everest:A1:  Kernel panic when
		running dt during max sessions test
		(cnic:cnic_get_bnx2x_ctx+0x59/0x6e)
       Cause:   Couple of issues attributed to this issue,
		1. bug in ep structure handling code in bnx2i driver
		2. memory corruption due to boundary over stepping in
		   bnx2x driver (fixed in 1.46.9)
       Change:  revamped endpoints offload / destroy list handling code
       Impact:  57710

    2. Problem: Cont00037858 - Linux iSCSI:Everest:A1:  bnx2i: ofld_timer:
		CONN_DISCON timeouts when running login/logout continuously
		to max number of sessions
       Cause:   bug in ep offload / destroy list handling code in bnx2i driver
       Change:  revamped endpoints offload / destroy list handling code
       Impact:  57710

    3. Problem: Cont00037701 - LinuxiSCSI:EverestA1: Kernel Panic whe running
		traffic on both ports
       Cause:   same as Cont00037814
       Change:  see Cont00037814 above
       Impact:  57710

  Enhancements
  ============
	Updated driver logs section in README.TXT 


Version 1.3.5 (Oct 06, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00037576 - Linux iSCSI:Everest:A1: Unable to connect
		to more than 64 sessions per port
       Cause:   With 8 pages limit driver was able to allocate only 72 endpoint
		structures.
       Change:  Doubled number of pages used for endpoint structures to 16
       Impact:  57710

    2. Problem: Test 5.9 failure with kernel panic
       Cause:   Incorrect handling in error path was causing SCSI-ML to
		free device resources while some commands are still active.
		Thus causing kernel panic when driver tried to unmap SG list
		at a later point in time
       Change:  cleaned up session recovery path and cleanup active command list
		in case host_reset() failed.
       Impact:  57710

  Enhancements
  ============
	Increased TCP CLOSE timeout to 20-secs from 10 -secs to be in sync with
	firmware limits


Version 1.3.4 (Sept 26, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00037386 - Linux iSCSI: Installing drivers via
		source tarball will not create a bnx2id startup script
       Cause:   Previous release was partially fixed and user still
		need to run 'chkconfig' to get it to work
       Change:  Added 'chkconfig' to fix the issue properly
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710

    2. Problem: Cont00037576 - Linux iSCSI:Everest:A1: Unable to connect
		to more than 64 sessions per port
       Cause:   It was hardcoded in header file
       Change:  Fixed code to limit 64 simultaneous iscsi connection on
		5706/5708/5709 and 128 connection on 57710
       Impact:  57710


  Enhancements
  ============
	Increased num outstanding tasks (SQ size) to 256 for 57710. 570x still
	has SQ size of 128


Version 1.3.3 (Sept 22, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00037386 - Linux iSCSI: Installing drivers via
		source tarball will not create a bnx2id startup script
       Cause:   In previous release only carried partial fix by installing
		only the binary, 'bnx2id' and not the init script
       Change:  updated makefile to copy init script along with 'bnx2id' binary
		when 'install_usr' build target is issued.  This was initially
		fixed in 1.2.12 and got omitted in later releases
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709/57710


  Enhancements
  ============
	Added debug prints in ep_connect() and ep_disconnect() code path to
 	easily identify option-2 related issues


Version 1.3.2 (Sept 14, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
 	1) Inserted BUG_ON() to trap TCP disconnect timeout 
	2) Turned off TCP timestamp and fixed receive window to 256K
	3) Added code to replenish RQ buffers before issuing  any iscsi requests


Version 1.3.1 (Aug 07, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00035910 - LinuxiSCSI:Kernel panic when running
		login/logout with 64 sessions
       Cause:   iop mapped memory for connection doorbells was not
		unmapped and also a small piece of memory was not freed.
		This caused a slow memory leak and eventually system would
		run out of memory 
       Change:  Fixed memory leak issue
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709


  Enhancements
  ============
	Updates README.TXT file to add 'iface' usage with examples.
  Fixed a critical corruption issue caused by memset() while clearing
  SQ/RQ/CQ page table for 57710 devices, failed to adjust actual size
  of page table which starts at an offset of DB structure size from
  the base address.
  


Version 1.2.14 (June 20, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Updates README.TXT file to clarify Broadcom iSCSI Offload software suite
	loading process. Fixed init rc script to manually unload bnx2i and
	cnic driver when bnx2id service is stopped. Earlier we would do
	'modprobe -r' which could potentially unload bnx2 module and even bring
	the network interface down. 'service bnx2id stop' is only intended to
	unload iscsi(storage) modules, keeping networking components intact.


Version 1.2.13 (June 19, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00035285 - DF216309: Open iSCSI Initiators Not Provided for
		RHEL5.2 and SLES10.2
       Cause:   This was caused by interface change resulted in changes in
		iscsi transport. This caused a data structure to be referenced
		after being freed.
       Change:  Fixed session teardown code take care of this interface change
       Impact:  SLES10 SP2 and 5706/5708/5709

  Enhancements
  ============
	Removed all references to 57710 in README.TXT file and going forward
	Broadcom will release single iscsi-initiator package for Redhat EL 5.0,
	5.1 and 5.2


Version 1.3.0 (June 02, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Complete support for 57710 added


Version 1.2.12 (May 23, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00035452 - Linux iSCSI: Installing drivers via source
		tarball will not create a bnx2id startup script
       Cause:   In previous release only carried partial fix by installing
		only the binary, 'bnx2id' and not the init script
       Change:  updated makefile to copy init script along with 'bnx2id' binary
		when 'install_usr' build target is issued
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.2.11 (May 22, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00035451 - Linux iSCSI:  Typo in line 29 of bnx2id
		startup script
       Cause:   typo
       Change:  fixed the comment line in code
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709

    2. Problem: Cont00035292 - Unnecessary Set Group ID Permission in
		bnx2i Source
       Cause:   file permissions got changed unintentionally
       Change:  set correct file permissions for source code files
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709

    3. Problem: Cont00035452 - Linux iSCSI: Installing drivers via source
		tarball will not create a bnx2id startup script
       Cause:   not implemented
       Change:  added 'install_usr' command to Makefile and document the
		required steps in README text
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.2.10 (May 14, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00035222 - DF215961: Cannot Compile bxn2i-1.2.8 on SLES10sp2
       Cause:   SLES10SP2 back ported create_session() to include 2 additional
		arguments and thus causing minor compilation warning. Also it
		would create problems when use attempts to establish an
		iscsi connection
       Change:  Modified makefile to detect number of argument to create_session
		by looking at function prototype in header file,
		include/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.h
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709, uses 'awk' to parse the header file efficiently

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.2.9 (May 08, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00035222 - DF215961: Cannot Compile bxn2i-1.2.8 on SLES10sp2
       Cause:   Similar to Cont00035035, but SLES10 update 2 back ported
		scsi_set_resid & scsi_get_resid and placed them in
		include/scsi/iscsi_compat.h whereas RHEL 5.2 put them in
		include/scsi/scsi_cmnd.h
       Change:  Modified makefile to accommodate these differences
       Impact:  5706/5708/5709

    2. Problem: Cont00034621 - Linux iSCSI Xinan:  Multiple iSCSI sessions
		occasionally do not recover after cable pull
       Cause:   Sending TCP_RESET KWQE on a connection for which option-2 connect
		was not initiated (TCP_CONNECT 1/3) caused neighboring iscsi
		connection context memory to corrupt
       Change:  bnx2i will not issue cm_abort() if option-2 connect was not
		successful, it will directly send request to destroy the context
       Impact:  5709

    3. Problem: Cont00034872 - Linux iSCSI Xinan: Target does not recover
		when running MPIO over both Xinan ports
       Cause:   duplicate of Cont00034621
       Change:  See Cont00034621 for details
       Impact:  5709

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.2.8 (May 02, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00034848 - Linux iSCSI Xinan: No network activity
		(possible chip lockup) after running pqa script
		(test 6.1-- Errors from initiator to target) in
		a loop using IPv6.
       Cause:   wrong ITT was posted with login request causing 5709 firmware
		to hang. This was caused because upper 2-bits weren't clearing
		before putting aborted SCSI WRITE command's ITT to free list.
		Same issue won't happen if aborted command was a SCSI READ,
		because command type field is '0' for read commands. Also
		normal scsi completion won't suffer the same as driver clears
		this field before starting completion processing 
       Change:  Driver clears command type fields whenever freeing an ITT value
       Impact:  5709

    2. Problem: Cont00035035 - DF214119: bnx2i-1.2.7 Fails to Compile on
		RHEL5.2-snapshot6
       Cause:   Newer Linux api functions, scsi_set_resid() and scsi_get_resid()
		were back ported to 2.6.18-88 kernel in RHEL5.2 resulting in
		compilation errors because of duplicate definitions
       Change:  worked around in make file. This is a tricky issue caused by
		distro's backporting newer features back to older kernels.
		This causes following scenario -
		1. RHEL 5.1 kernel 2.6.18-53 does not define these functions
		2. RHEL 5.2 kernel 2.6.18-88 does define these functions
		3. kernels 2.6.19.x to 2.6.22.x does not define it
		4. kernel 2.6.23.x+ is part of kernel by default
		This makes it hard as it can't be determined whether to define
		ourselves or use kernel api's based on linux version as 
		LINUX_VERSION takes into account only first 3 bytes out of
		2.6.x-y. We counter this by greping for function prototypes
		in the include directory and based on grep result define macros
		which facilitates either local definition or references the kernel
		api's
       Impact:  5709

    3. Problem: Cont00034274 - Linux iSCSI:  Running heavy stress on multiple sessions
		causes connection resets and other errors
       Cause:   duplicate of Cont00034848
       Change:  duplicate of Cont00034848
       Impact:  5709

    4. Problem: Cont00034977 - B57DELLCDT447 Contains Two Different Open iSCSI
		Packages for RHEL5
       Cause:   Two open-iscsi packages are for RHEL5.0 and  RHEL5.1
       Change:  updates README text file to reflect the importance of two RHEL
		related open-iscsi packages
       Impact:  NA

    5. Problem: Cont00035034 - DF213523: Offload Driver (bnx2i) not getting installed
		on RHEL5.2
       Cause:   Duplicate of Cont00035035, package manager was not able to install
		the driver because non was built due to compilation error
       Change:  Duplicate of Cont00035035, package manager was not able to install
		the driver because non was built due to compilation error
       Impact:  NA


  Enhancements
  ============
	User will be able to compile and install bnx2i on RHEL5.2, but would like
	to remind users/OEMs that RHEL5.2 does not feature in supported distributions
	list for this release and only minimal validation is achieved.


Version 1.2.7 (Apr 10, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00034704 - Linux iSCSI Xinan: Target occasionally
		does not recover when running ifup/down
       Cause:   This is an expected behavior based on the very nature
		of the test script and environment. Test script continously
		toggles the interface up & down with a time difference of
		1-sec. Also the interface is configured to aquire IP address
		via' dhcp, which actually takes upto several seconds.
		So iSCSI stack will hardly get a chance to reconnect to
		target lun and after 120-secs SCSI disk will be taken offline
       Change:  Not applicable (not a bug)
       Impact:  5709

    2. Problem: Cont00034705 - Linux iSCSI: Errors seen when running ifup/down
		with multiple targets attached
       Cause:   logic issue where a loop variable is not reset for each
		session processing causing 2nd and subsequent sessions
		to be retried for infinitely long time.
       Change:  fixed the logic
       Impact:  5709

Version 1.2.6 (Apr 07, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00034260 - Linux iSCSI:  Kernel panic while performing
		ifup/down with target connected
       Cause:   Shutdown thread was waiting for 10-secs for iscsi driver to
		cleanup all active session whereas ep_disconnect() thread
		also has 10-sec timeout for TCP connection shutdown. This
		was causing shutdown thread to return before connection
		context destruction
       Change:  TCP connection termination timeout is set to a lower value
       Impact:  5709

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.2.5 (Apr 03, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00034315 - Linux iSCSI Xinan: Scanning disks during
			max sessions test causes connection problems
       Cause:   CID range allocated by cnic driver was not in sync with
		firmware expectation causing firmware to allocate CID
		range for which memory is not allocated by the driver
       Change:  sync'ed driver range with the firmware range
       Impact:  fixes host memory corruption caused by this mis-match

    2. Problem: Cont00034260 - Linux iSCSI:  Kernel panic while performing
		ifup/down with target connected
       Cause:   Timing issue caused cnic driver to free resources & stop
		hardware while bnx2i is still registered. This resulted in
		cnic driver crash when bnx2i calls cm_destroy() api call to
		free 'cnic_sock'
       Change:  During repetitive shutdown process driver avoids async events
		such as connection completion notifications, teardown and
		connection destroy taks and relies on top level session freeze
		to keep sanity
       Impact:  Fixes system crash

    3. Problem: Cont00031780 - LinuxiSCSI:Unable to load bnx2id from
		iscsiBoot on suse X86-64
       Cause:   RPM package was only install 32-bit version of 'bnx2id' and
		relied of COMPAT feature in kernel module for interoperability.
		However bnx2i source package did included a 64-bit version of
		the binary and user was expected to install manually by hand
       Change:  RPM install script is modified to install 'bnx2id' binary based
		on system architecture
       Impact:  Manual installed required to get iSCSI boot for 64-bit
		architecture is no more required

    4. Problem: Cont00033922 - Linux iSCSI Xinan:  Kernel oops when doing
		"service network restart"
       Cause:   duplicate of Cont00034260
       Change:  refer to Cont00034260 for more details
       Impact:  refer to Cont00034260 for more details

    5. Problem: Cont00031404 - Linux iSCSI:  A successful login occurs
		eventhough initiator receives login response with T-bit
		and C-bit set to 1
       Cause:   open-iscsi user daemon wasn't validating (C-bit && T-bit)
		on received login response
       Change:  updated open-iscsi code to accomodate this in
		6.2.0.742-0.6c (RHEL5.0), 6.2.0.865-0.8b (RHEL 5.1)
       Impact:  minimal

    6. Problem: Cont00034385 - DF205266: DKMS RPM for bnx2i will not
		install with bnx2 and bnx2x present
       Cause:   install script was running 'rpm -qa | grep "bnx2.*rpm"'
		to determine multiple instances of bnx2 RPM is installed.
		But 57710 dkms rpm is named "bnx2x-*" which also matches
		the previous expression misleading script to believe multiple
		instance of same driver.
       Change:  Modified the search pattern to avoid pitfall
       Impact:  DKMS

    7. Problem: Cont00034316 - LinuxiSCSI: When installing bnx2i rpm package
		on Linux-64, it does not install bnx2id64, iscsiboot needs
		bnx2id64
       Cause:   RPM package was only install 32-bit version of 'bnx2id' and
		relied of COMPAT feature in kernel module for interoperability.
		However bnx2i source package did included a 64-bit version of
		the binary and user was expected to install manually by hand
       Change:  RPM install script is modified to install 'bnx2id' binary based
		on system architecture
       Impact:  Manual installed required to get iSCSI boot for 64-bit
		architecture is no more required

Version 1.2.4 (Mar 17, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
	Couple of issues related to PTE setup and queue size adjustments for
  57710 are fixed. Also resolved issues with 'sysfs' entry being read during
  driver load which used to crash the system because it was triggering
  context stage buffer and PCI bar register access which are suppose to be
  initialized during iscsi conn offload process. Driver now checks and returns
  error if the context stage buffer or the pci bar mapping is not present

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00034202 - linuxiSCSI:bnx2i failed to compile on
		SLES10SP1 X86-64
       Cause:   missing pci definition due to older kernel
       Change:  changed code to include 'resource_size_t' only if running
		Linux kernel >= 2.6.18
       Impact:  SLES 10u1 testing

  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.2.2 (Mar 10, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Modified code to rearrange additional 'iscsi_kwqe_conn_offload3' to
  include first RQ PTE followed by first CQ PTE [1 - 7]. As we don't intend
  to include multiple CQ per connection in initial release, bnx2i will only
  send '1' additional 'iscsi_kwqe_conn_offload3'

Version 1.2.1 (Feb 27, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Added docbook style function & structure definition header and
  defined new kwqe 'iscsi_kwqe_conn_offload3' required for offload support
  on 57710


Version 1.2.0 (Feb 21, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
	None

  Enhancements
  ============
	Added initial code to support 57710 device


Version 1.1.8 (Feb 20, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00033893 - Linux iSCSI: bnx2id does not automatically
		get loaded with v1.1.5
       Cause:   init scripts, bnx2id.redhat & bnx2id.suse included in v1.1.5
		was in DOS file format, for that reason it was not executed
		during system boot
       Change:  Converted init scripts to UNIX format
       Impact:  5708/5709 iscsi testing


  Enhancements
  ============
	None


Version 1.1.7 (Feb 20, 2008)
============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00033898 - Linux iSCSI: kernel panic when connecting
		to targets with bnx2i v1.1.5
       Cause:   Timing issue caused by new interface change b/w bnx2i/cnic/bnx2
		Earlier 'pcidev' was available when NX2 device is presented to
		bnx2i and recently CNIC was modified to expose 'pcidev' only
		after bnx2i registers the device. But it could happen interrupt
		is processed in register device context causing kernel panic
       Change:  bnx2i HBA adapter and pci_dev binding is determined in
		bnx2i_start() instead of waiting for register_device() compl.
		It is gauranteed bnx2i_start() is called before CNIC interrupts
		are enabled on the device.
       Impact:  5708/5709 iscsi testing

Version 1.1.6 (Feb 19, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00033899 - Linux iSCSI: RPM build errors on
		SLES10 SP1 with bnx2i v1.1.5
       Cause:   missing PCI id macro for 5709 in pci_ids.h header file
       Change:  If not defined driver will define the macro to support
		older kernel such as 2.6.16 carried by SUSE 10SP1
       Impact:  5709 testing on SUSE10 SP1


  Enhancements

Version 1.1.5 (Feb 13, 2008)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====

  Fixes
  =====
       None

  Enhancements
  ============
	IPv6 support added.


Version 1.1.2 (Dec 06, 2007)
=============================

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00031780 - LinuxiSCSI:Unable to load bnx2id from
		iscsiBoot on suse X86-64
       Cause:   missing 32-bit compat libraries
       Change:  use 64-bit binary distributed in the package
       Impact:  Use 64-bit 'bnx2id' binary in iSCSI boot environment

    2. Problem: Cont00032801 - bnx2i: Add 64 bit bnx2id to the release
       Cause:   NA
       Change:  source package includes 64-bit binary under
		'bnx2i-1.x.y/bin/bnx2id64' (need to rename as 'bnx2id')
       Impact:  Enables user to build initrd image for 64-bit system
	
    3. Problem: Cont00032141 - Linux iSCSI:  Update README for MPIO
		behavior in Section 5
       Cause:   default values got changed in the latest open-iscsi package
       Change:  Documentation changes
       Impact:  None

    4. Problem: Cont00032671 - Linux iSCSI: Interface up/down stress
		causes kernel softlockup with 5706S
       Cause:   race condition and also hba shutdown thread was
		un-necessarily waiting on an event which is mutually exclusive
		ending up in timeout every single time. This wait cluase
		speeds hba shutdown process resulted because of 'ifdown'
		command
       Change:  fixed spin_lock issues and removed unnecessary wait event
		mentioned above
       Impact:  None

Version 1.0.32 (Oct 18, 2007)
=============================
  FIRMWARE - 	3.7.19
  ========

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00031905 - Linux iSCSI: login/logout stress against
		wintarget with multiple luns causes kernel panic
       Cause:   This was an issue caused by Win Targets wierd behavior of
		holding on to SCSI INQUIRY response till TMF is sent. Other
		issue was a race condition when logging off iSCSI session
		while TMF request is pending. this would clear out all
		commands while TCM timer was still active. When TMF timer
		expires, it tries to operate on a command already freed
		when session logged out.
       Change:  if TMF is active while trying to logout, driver will wait for
		TMF request to either complete or timeout. Only them it will
		send iSCSI logout pdu.
       Impact:  iSCSI TMF and iSCSI Logout rocessing

    2. Problem: Cont00031884 - Linux iSCSI:  Kernel panic with ifdown/up
		when logged into target with 5708s
       Cause:   This issue was caused by a race condition depending on when
		GOING_DOWN message is received by the driver. Once this message
		is received, driver will start cleaning up all active sessions
		and any session already in recovery mode won't be bothered.
		But when this bug is hit, GOING_DOWN was received when session
		was in login in phase (recovery mode) and driver let it continue
		and return to user. Once bnx2i returns to cnic, cnic driver would
		release all resources including cnic_sock structures. One of the
		cnic_sock structure belonged to iscsi session which was going
		through login phase. This connection will stay alive and will
		be cleaned up during next iteration of interface bring down and
		CNIC driver won't find refence to this cnic_sock as it was
		already freed.
       Change:  When HBA is shuting down, driver will wait for recovering
		sessions to complete iSCSI, then tear active sessions down
		before returing to user
       Impact:  HBA shutdown code

  FIRMWARE - 	3.7.16
  ========

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00031787 - Linux iSCSI: Red Hat system becomes
		unresponsive after cable pull test
       Cause:   SCSI-ML issue which got in 2.6.19 kernel. Run same test on
		2.6.23 kernel and it did not exhibit this issue. For more
		details refer to following URL's 
		https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.20/+bug/118833
		http://lists.parisc-linux.org/pipermail/parisc-linux-cvs/2006-September/037006.html
       Change:  To avoid crossing the recursion limit of 19, driver sets
		'cmd_per_lun' parameter n scsi_host_template to 16
       Impact:  Could lower iops when measured on a single iSCSI connection

Version 1.0.30 (Oct 05, 2007)
=============================
  FIRMWARE - 	3.7.16
  ========

  NOTICE	- iSCSI License enforcement is turned on.
  ======

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00031668 - Linux iSCSI Offload Licensing not enforced
       Cause:   Dupicate of CQ31577, FW identifies the card as HP NIC instead
		of HP LOM, FW was checking for entire register instead of a
		specific bit
       Change:  change the checking to refer to only a specific bit in MCP's
		scratchpad and not the entire register
       Impact:  Licensing should work as expected on oem systems

    2. Problem: Cont00031671 - Linux iSCSI: unable to connect to maximum number
		of sessions (64), on an x86_64 system
       Cause:   Driver was allocating only 40 endpoint structures on
		64-bit systems. Driver has a logic of allocating a maximum of
		#n pages of memory for each control structures (endpoint,
		connection, session, etc') and #n is set to 4. On a 32-bit
		system size of endpoint structure is 256B whereas on a 64bit
		system it is ~400B. So driver was able to allocate 40 endpoint
		structures
       Change:  increaded number of pages per control structure to '8'
       Impact:  None

    3. Problem: Cont00031655 - Linux iSCSI:  bnx2i: Error message - cmd not
		allocated w/ v1.0.29
       Cause:   one command structure was getting leaked when session goes into
		recovery due to nop-out timeout
       Change:  NOPOUT requests are also queued in active command queue and
		freed when session is cleaned up
       Impact:  None

    4. Problem: Cont00031662 - Linux iSCSI: Kernel Oops running disktest with
		maximum sessions test
       Cause:   driver was hard coding "sht->can_queue' parameter to 128
		(max outstanding commands issued by SCS-ML). Where as the
		QP size was decreased using 'sysfs'. It get more complicated as
		 'can_queue' parameter is advertised when iscsi transport is
		registered which happens even before 'sysfs' setup. So will have
		to remove 'sysfs' support for changing SQ/RQ/CQ size and instead
		provide module parameters to choose these parameters based on
		requirements for number of the iSCSI connection
       Change:  Removed 'sysfs' support for changing SQ/RQ/CQ size and instead
		module parameters are included to change these parameters.
		Also 4 command structures are reserved for slow path (TMF ABORT,
		NOP-OUT, etc) commands.
       Impact:  None


  Enhancements
  ============
	Broadcom user daemon is renamed to 'bnx2id' and ioctl support added
instead of 'sysfs'

       Impact:  None

    2. Problem: Cont00031509 - LinuxiSCSI:iSCSIBoot failed to to successfully
		login to EMC ratget
       Cause:   Unusual behavior of kernel call neigh_event_send()
       Change:   neigh_event_send() returns error after sending the first ARP
		entry. This error must be ignored and we should only rely on
		subsequent NETEVENT_NEIGH_UPDATE for proper neighbour status.
       Impact:  None

    3. Problem: Cont00031517 - LinuxiSCSIBoot: Connection is not restored
		when disconnecting Primary HSRP router
       Cause:   2.6.16 kernel does not support NETEVENT_NEIGH_UPDATE
       Change:  2.6.16 kernel does not support NETEVENT_NEIGH_UPDATE, so router
		failover with gratuitous ARP will be unknown to the driver.
		To fix this issue, a timer was added to check the ARP entries
		periodically to detect ARP changes on 2.6.16 kernels.

    1. Problem: Cont00031421 - Linux iSCSI: Hotplug feature - Does not reconnect
		to target if nic is removed and put back in if there is already
		an iSCSI session established
       Cause:   Offload driver cannot support this and driver will cleanup all
		activer iSCSI session/connections which also includes all
		outstanding commands and even releases the adapter structure
		as part of hot remove. When the adapter is added there won't
		be enough state information to restore the session.  It is
		is a good idea to orderly shutdown all iSCSI sessions before

       Change:  Will not be addressed
       Impact:  None

    2. Problem: Cont00031193 - LinuxiSCSI:iSCSIBoot continously drops and then
		recover iscsi connection
       Cause:   This issue happens when 'iscsid' daemon is killed and restarted
		while one or more iSCSI session are active. When the daemon is
		restarted, it does not have reference to old TCP connection but
		it knows iSCSI session and connection information. So iscsid
		blindly stops the iSCSI connection, establishes a new
		TCP connection and tries to bind it to iSCSI connection. This
		results in a resource conflict situation as there is already
		a TCP conn bound to iSCSI connection causing a bad state with
		broken link between EP and CONN structures
       Change:  When driver detects this condition old TCP connection is
		shutdown and cleaned up before binding the new TCP connection
		to iSCSI connection
       Impact:  None

    3. Problem: Cont00031205 - iscsid does not get the established session info

       Cause:   some targets do not explicitly respond to NOPOUTs when there are
		active commands. These iSCSI targets expect initiator to update
		sequence numbers from SCSI CMD RESPONSE pdus
       Change:  bnx2i driver will not send nopout on wire when following
		conditions are met -
		1. there are active SCSI commands 
		2. one or more SCSI commands where sent between this and
		   previous nopout request

   		Instead driver will itself respond to nopout. Infact we can even
		change iscsid to keep track of 'cmdsn' and  send down nopout
		request only if connect is truely idle. We will evaluate changes
		to iscsid and work to community to incorporate the change. 
       Impact:  Initiator's proactive NOPOUTs are not seen on wire when the
		iSCSI connection is not truely idle

    4. Problem: Cont00031121 - Linux iSCSI: Kernel panic when running
		ifdown/up test + disktest
       Cause:   In interface going down notification, iSCSI connection context
		was destroyed without tearing down the TCP connection.
		Another issue was option-2 s/w was not handling
		'SYN - ACK - RST' condition properly.
       Change:  Code is fixed to attempt TCP connection shutdown (FIN/RST)
		before destroying connection context.
       Impact:  none

    5. Problem: Cont00031024 - Linux iSCSI:  Keyboard locks up when running
		traffic to Sanrad w/ Suse10 SP1
       Cause:   There were a bunch of issue uncovered by this test -
		1. race condition in cleanup code 
		2. error while assigning LUN value during TMF request wqe
		3. issue related to RQ producer index posting, from the second
		   wraparound, indices posted was in the range 0x0 - 0x10,
		   0x8000 - 0x8010. Correct RQ producer index range is
		   0x1 - 0x10, 0x8001 - 0x8010 (this example considers total
		   of 16 RQ buffers)
		4. RQ producer suppose to be increment by driver on every
		   unsolicited PDU that generated a CQE(even without iSCSI data)
       Change:  code changes to take care of all above said issues
       Impact:  none

    6. Problem: Cont00031221 - Linux iSCSI:  Bonnie++ reports drastic I/O error
		when running to EMC AX100SCi target
       Cause:   combination of Cont00031304 and Cont00031024 (issue #4)
       Change:  combination of Cont00031304 and Cont00031024 (issue #4)
       Impact:  none

    7. Problem: Cont00031203 - Linux iSCSI:  LUN rescan does not complete after
		cable pull when connected to multiple targets
       Cause:   couple of issues attributed to this issue -
		1. order of conditional checks - link down check was before
		   session recovery state. Actually order should be reversed
		2. old recovery state should be a per session attribute but
		   instead was kept as static variable in bnx2i_queuecommand().
		   When there were multiple sessions this broke state transition 
       Change:  Fixed both the issues
       Impact:  None

    8. Problem: Cont00031194 - Linux iSCSI: traffic does not resume on standby
		nic when cable pulled during MPIO testing
       Cause:   couple of issues attributed to this issue -
		1. order of conditional checks - link down check was before
		   session recovery state. Actually order should be reversed
		2. old recovery state should be a per session attribute but
		   instead was kept as static variable in bnx2i_queuecommand().
		   When there were multiple sessions this broke state transition 
       Change:  Fixed both the issues
       Impact:  none

    9. Problem: Cont00031383 - LinuxiSCSI:iSCSIBoot encounters connection
		failure during iscsiBoot
       Cause:   Related to option-2 issue of not handling 'SYN - ACK - RST'
		condition properly.
       Change:  Instead of sending Reset on bad ack sequence segment when
		expecting syn/ack, just redirect to L2 in order for it to
		send the reset (for the sake of simplicity)
       Impact:  Second SYN request should succeed in establish the
		3-way handshake


  Enhancements
  ============
	Event coalescing is implemented

Version 1.0.18 (Aug 30, 2007)
=============================
  FIRMWARE - 	3.7.11
  ========

  NOTICE	- iSCSI License enforcement is turned on.
  ======

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00031121 - Linux iSCSI: Kernel panic when running
		ifdown/up test + disktest
       Cause:   Driver was not tearing down the connection when interface was
		brought down. This was causing TCP connection to be active on
		the target side and won't let initiator to reuse the port.
		Driver is fixed to attemp TCP connection teardown but firmware
		needs to fixed as well to either indicate error status to
		driver or return sending SYN packet when first 3-way handshake
		fails
       Change:  Driver initiates TCP connection teardown process before
		cleaning up iSCSI state
       Note:    Need firmware fix to resolve SYN - ACK - RST issue as same
		issue will resurface when 'ifdown' command is issued when cable
		is disconnected

=============================
  FIRMWARE - 	3.7.11
  ========

  NOTICE	- iSCSI License enforcement is turned on.
  ======

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00031063 - Linux iSCSI: Kernal panic when attempting
		target login (w/o authentication) with certain login parameters
       Cause:   this is an iET target implementation issue. Target is not
		setting 'F' bit in the last datain pdu of a sequence.
		In this test scenario, MBL = MRDSL (initiator) = 2K and the
		command was a scsi read \ with exp data length = 4K.
		Target sends 2 datain's  -
		   1. datasn=0, data segment len = 2K, F=0, S=0
		   2. datasn=1, data segment len = 2K, F=1, S=1

		In first DATAIN pdu, 'F' should have been set to '1'.
		MIPS firmware correclty detects the error & notifies the driver.
		Driver actually starts the recovery phase, but every single
		connection will end up in same fate as the 1st. As this happens
		in SCSI discovery phase right after the iSCSI login, user shell
		will never return and iscsid will keep retrying.
       Change:  Fixed driver crash issue and made code changes to iET software to
		be more 3720 compliant. SWE will publish the code changes to
		iET development community
       Impact:  none

  Enhancements
  ============
	Made some performance improvements change in CNIC driver which should
	avoid some spurious interrupts under heavy I/O

  NOTICE	- iSCSI License enforcement is turned on.
  ======

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00030122 - Linux iSCSI: Disk does not reappear after
		cable pull on Sanrad target
       Cause:   link change events was not handled in iscsi driver
       Change:  Link change events are handled in driver correctly and
		bnx2i driver will not issue new scsi commands / scsi tmf
		requests to chip if the link is down
       Impact:  none

    2. Problem: Cont00031024 - Linux iSCSI:  Keyboard locks up when running
		traffic to Sanrad w/ Suse10 SP1
       Cause:   This issue uncovered few bugs -
		1. race condition in cleanup code
		2. there was a coding error while assigning LUN value
		   during TMF request wqe formation
		3. logic error in RQ producer index posting - from second
		   RQ index wrap around, producer index posted was
		   (0x0 - RQ_Size) and (0x8000 - (0x8000 + RQ_Size)).
		   Correct indices range is (0x1 - RQ_Size) and

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00030892 - Linux iSCSI:  Enhancement Request - Print out
		appropriate message when session cannot be established due to
		restriction in iSCSI licenses
       Cause:   MIPS firmware was returning single failure error code
       Change:  MIPS firmware returns newly defined error code if unable to
		allocate iSCSI context space
       Impact:  None

    2. Problem: Cont00030042 - Linux ISCSI - Session freezes running
		ISCSI initiator at 10Mb/s-Hd
       Cause:   iscsi_discovery script under open-iscsi/utils folder was used to
		discover and connect to targets.  This scripts was using iSER to
		connect to target, so in effect 2 simulaneous connections were
		made to target
       Change:  not to use iscsi_discovery
       Impact:  None

    3. Problem: Cont00031024 - Linux iSCSI:  Keyboard locks up when running
		traffic to Sanrad w/ Suse10 SP1
       Cause:   race condition in cleanup code and also there was a coding error
		while assigning LUN value during TMF request wqe formation
       Change:  cleaned up error path to hammer out few remaining bugs
       Impact:  More stable error recovery code

    4. Problem: Cont00031040 - Linux iSCSI:  Kernel oops occurs between long
		transmit timout and recovery.
       Cause:   Same as Cont00031024 
       Change:  Same as Cont00031024

    6. Problem: Cont00030809 - Linux iSCSI:  Able to log in to target when
		FirstBurstLength > MaxBurstLength
       Cause:   This is a iSCSI target implementation issue - during login
		reponse following parameters were agreed b/w target and
		the initiator -
		1. MaxBurstLength (MBL) - 32768
		2. FirstBurstLength (FBL) - 65536
		3. MaxReceiveDataSegmentLength Initiator - 131072 (advertised)
		4. MaxReceiveDataSegmentLength Target - 8192 (not advertised,
			spec defaults)
		5. ImmediateData=Yes
		6. InitialR2T=Yes

		When all these parameters are put together Initiator can only
		send 8192B of immediate data and no unsolicited data. So any
		negotiated FBL value greater than 8192 is a waste and target
		might be ignoring it.
       Change:  Third party issue
       Impact:  Won't be addressed

  Enhancements
  ============
	Fixed one issue related to iSCSI R2T statistic counter update code.
	Also 'portbind' utility is bundled with this release and the user has
	to start the daemon before attempting to establish iSCSI sessions

=============================
  FIRMWARE 	- 3.7.10_b0
  ========

  NOTICE	- iSCSI License is required to use iSCSI Offload
  ======

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00030950 - Linux iSCSI:  FIN packet is NOT sent out
		from initiator after each target logout.
       Cause:   Driver was using a single flag to mark FIN received and
		RST received. Driver used to skip cm_close() path when this
		flag is set and directly initiate connection context destroy
       Change:  Now this flag is separated into 2 different flag bits
		and driver will take following action based on state machine -
		1. FIN received -  initiated an option-2 request to send FIN
		   if remote socket layer sent us FIN either with logout
		   respons PDU or standalone TCP segment with FIN flags set
		2. RST received - will skip cm_close() path and directly
		   proceeds to destroy connection context
       Impact:  should also resolve occational "4 - encountered connection
		failure" error condition when attempting to create a
		new iSCSI connection

    2. Problem: Cont00030948 - Linux iSCSI:  Kernel Oops occurs after
		3-way handshake (for target login) failed.
       Cause:   In ep_disconnection thread driver tried to dereference
		a null pointer, ep->sess. this structure element is assigned
		correct value in conn_bind() routine and this routine is not
		called when ep_connect() fails because of 3-way handshake
		failure
       Change:  Check validity of ep->sess pointer before de-referencing
       Impact:  None

    3. Problem: Cont00030903 - Linux iSCSI:  Cannot log in to target after
		unloading/loading iSCSI offload drivers if iscsid is not
		restarted
       Cause:   Everytime is driver is unloaded and reloaded, it is not
		guarenteed the same 64-bit handle is allocated to
		iSCSI transport name. 'iscsid', open-iscsi user daemon
		will cache transport attributes/properties only when the
		transport name is first discovered. This will result in
		'iscsid' trying to use the stale transport handle which
		is not recoqnized by kernel iscsi tranport module 
       Change:  'iscsid' is changed to check for changed transport handles
		of existing transport names while scanning iscsi transports
		directory for updates
       Impact:  Need to co-ordinate with Mike Christie to push this change
		upstream

    4. Problem: Cont00029670 - Linux ISCSI - encounter error
		(4 - encountered connection failure) when loging to the target
       Cause:   related to Cont00030948, as initiator did not send FIN - ACK,
		socket was alive at the other end. This causes target to
		ignore SYN packet when tuple matches with exisiting active
		connection and send an ACK segment instead
       Change:  Driver code is modified to gracefully shutdown the connection
		with a FIN/ACK TCP segment before destroying the
		iSCSI connection context. This ensure ordely shutdown of
		TCP socket at the other end.
       Impact:  None

    5. Problem: Cont00030227 - Linux iSCSI: Login/logout and traffic stress
		test causes kernel panic
       Cause:   KCQ context was not properly re-initialize when driver
		tries to stop KCQ and re-init KWQ/KCQ
       Change:  driver and mips firmware was fixed to correctly re-initialize
		KCQ context when KWQ/KCQ is re-initilaized by the driver
       Impact:  None

    6. Problem: Cont00030817 - Linux iSCSI:  Login/logout stress causes
		iscsid process to disappear
       Cause:   related to Cont00030227
       Change:  refer to Cont00030227 entry above
       Impact:  None

  ========

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00029443 - Linux iSCSI:  iSCSI licenses in xDiag not
		enforced
       Cause:   not implemented as licensing scheme was finalized very recently
       Change:  Licensing code is implemented in MIPS firmware
       Impact:  iSCSI Offload won't work on engineering boards / servers LOMs
		which does not carry proper licensing

    2. Problem: Cont00030863 - Linux iSCSI:  Transport name for 5706 devices is
		titled bcm5708-xxxxxx w/ v1.0.07 and above
       Cause:   PCI device ID field was cleared by mistake which cased driver to
		choose the default device type, '5708'
       Change:  fixed in code
       Impact:  transport name format for 5706 devices will be 'bcm5706-xxxxxx'

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00030302 - Linux iSCSI: Session disconnect and
		kernel panic when formatting EMC target w/
		NOP Out interval set to 10
       Cause:   there were a few repeated iSCSI protocol warning messages
       Change:  Driver changed to display each warning once for each session
       Impact:  none

    2. Problem: Cont00029546 - Linux iSCSI:  Requires upgrade to 2.6.19
		kernel on Suse10
       Cause:   SLES10 update 1 had older open-iSCSI components
       Change:  SLES10 SP1 has a newer open-iSCSI and we don't need kernel upgrade
       Impact:  none

    3. Problem: Cont00030820 - Linux iSCSI:  Error messages seen on
		Cisco MDS 9216 target w/ v1.0.07
       Cause:   FW generates iSCSI Error KCQE for each iSCSI protocol
		violation whether is configured to be treated as warning
		or error. So driver will priting message for each indication,
		this caused a flury of messages and slowing down the system.
		Now driver is changed to print each type of warning only once.
       Change:  Driver prints message only once for each iSCSI protocol
		violation which is configured to be treated as WARNING
		and not an ERROR
       Impact:  none

    4. Problem: Cont00029689 - Linux iSCSI:  Maximum of 16 iSCSI sessions
		supported
       Cause:   Driver was limiting max offloaded connections to 32
       Change:  driver and FW are equipped to support upto 64 iSCSI connections
       Impact:  none

    5. Problem: Cont00030805 - Linux iSCSI:  iSCSI Rx Statistics not
		incrementing w/ v1.0.07
       Cause:   issue was introduced in v1.0.07 when code was revamped to
		meet Linux coding standards. A stale structure element
		was being check to determine whether the completion is for
		READ or WRITE command. 'Cuz of constant value of this
		absolete structure member, same code path was take all
		the time.
       Change:  Correct structure member is referenced to determine whether
		the command is SCSI READ or WRITE
		IMP: currently couple of counter are not correctly implemented
		in FW and should be taken care in next release. Other than
		these (R2T/DATAOUT pdu count) everything else look to be fine.
       Impact:  none

  Enhancements
  ============
	This release is tested on SUSE Enterprise Linux Server 10 (Service
Pack 1). Open-iSCSI packaged with SLES 10 SP1 works with offload iSCSI driver
and we do not require kernel update on SLES

Version 1.0.7 (July 25, 2007)
=============================
  FIRMWARE - 	3.7.7
  ========

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00030060 - Linux iSCSI: Hotplug using fakephp driver
			w/ iSCSI drivers loaded does not work
       Cause:   Hotplug feature was incomplete
       Change:  This is implemented correctly in cnic as well bnx2i driver
		in version 1.0.7 release
       Impact:  Hotplug feature is fully supported

    2. Problem: Cont00030302 - Linux iSCSI: Session disconnect and kernel panic
		when formatting EMC target w/ NOP Out interval set to 10
       Cause:   couple of issue attirbuted to this -
		1. race condition in driver caused by not properly guarding
		   critical sections
		2. EMC target has issues handling nop-out requests when
		   link is not idle, i.e. if a SCSI command follows  the nop-out,
		   it will not respond with nop-in. This caused system crash as
		   the driver was not properly recovering from this failure.
       Change:  System crash is fixed and the initiator reconnects to target
		after tearing down the connection
       Impact:  None

    3. Problem: Cont00030013 - Linux iSCSI: Running disktest read/write with
		NOP Out interval set to 10 causes system lockup
       Cause:   there was a bug in 'cmdsn' assignment code
       Change:  fixed 'cmdsn" assignement code
       Impact:  None

    4. Problem: Cont00030066 - ISCSI Linux - System hangs when issue a couple
		of ifdown/ifup command
       Cause:   There were few bugs in iscsi driver not properly synchronizing events
		such as connection setup and interface reset happening simultaneosuly.
		During ifdown, the cnic will shutdown and a number of bugs were triggered. 
		The L4 connection code did not unregister, and so during subsequent ifup,
		it could not be registered again.  There was also a lock imbalance when
		L4 connection code tried to register again, and this caused the soft lockup.
       Change:  Now it's all taken care and also driver tracks age of the adapter
		(number of times it's reset) which allows iscsi driver to detect if
		the network interface is reset between 2 events from iscsi daemon,
		e.g. connect establishment and login pdu send
       Impact:  None

    4. Problem: Cont00029719 - Linux iSCSI: Enhancement Request - MTU size > 1500
		should not be allowed for bnx2 driver
       Cause:   bnx2i driver was not checking MTU
       Change:  bnx2i driver will disallow any iSCSI connection offload if network device's
		MTU is > 1500B
       Impact:  

  Enhancements
  ============
	Source code was revamped to meet Linux coding standards


Version 1.0.6 (July 10, 2007)

  ========

  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00030435 - Linux iSCSI: Cannot log into certain targets 
		w/ driver package v1.0.05
       Cause:   Linux iSCSI package version 1.0.5 contained firmware version 3.7.4
		and it seems the firmware has this issue. This issue not

=============================
  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00030060 - Linux iSCSI: Hotplug using fakephp driver w/
		iSCSI drivers loaded does not work
       Cause:   Hotplug was not implemented properly
       Change:  Support was added in bnx2i driver and also bnx2i-cnic driver
		interface was upgraded to support hotplug
       Impact:  all of login - logout, driver load - unload test cases need
		to be re-run to thoroughly validate the interface change

  Enhancements
  ============
	1. This release includes iSCSI context dump utility and the required
		driver hooks is included in this release
	2. bnx2i and cnic driver interface changed quite a bit while adding
		hotplug support


Version 1.0.04 (May 30, 2007)

			login/logout on Equallogic target with v1.0.01
       Cause:   iSCSI driver was attempting to do session recovery every time
		it received a TCP FIN or RST from the remote  peer. Actually
		session recovery has to attempted only if the sess is in FFP state. 
       Change:  checks are put in place to avoid any un-necessary recovery attempts
       Impact:  none

    2. Problem: Cont00029655 - Linux ISCSI - Seeing error in the /var/log/messages
			when connecting to Linux target
       Cause:   duplicate of Cont00029452
       Change:  see notes for Cont00029452
       Impact:  none

    3. Problem: Cont00029662 - Linux iSCSI: Problem formatting EMC target
       Cause:   protocol violation (invalid LUN field in R2T PDU) by the target
       Change:  removed couple of strict protocol checking in MIPS firmware
       Impact:  might affect iSCSI protocol validation certifications, will
		reinstate the checks once we have this fixed in the target end.

    4. Problem: Cont00029690 - Linux iSCSI: Login attempt to 17th session causes
		the 16th session to be dropped
       Cause:  'cid_free_cnt' was not decremented after allocating a 'iscsi_cid'
		from the free list. This caused false queue full condition even
		when all the entries are allocated.
       Change:  'cid_free_cnt' is properly updated while allocating iscsi_cid from
		the free pool
       Impact:  driver will gracefully turn down request to open 17th connection

    5. Problem: Cont00029535 - Linux iSCSI: iSCSI session drops and fails to recover
       Cause:   There was a diconnect between BD table allocation and what is advertised
		to the SCSI layer. Driver was allocating BD table with max 32 entries
		for each command and what was registered with SCSI-ML was a bigger value. 
       Change:  Driver now allocates BD table of size equal to 'sg_tablesize' value
		specified in scsi_host_template structure
       Impact:  None

    6. Problem: Cont00029432 - Linux iSCSI:  Does not automatically reconnect to
		target after cable pull test
       Cause:   'fdisk -l' will result in couple of read commands and these gets
		queued up in the TX pipeline (retransmission queue) and firmware will
		not complete CMD_CLEANUP requests for commands that have some entries
		in the retransmission queue. Unless the number of CMD_CLEANUP requests
		issued and responses that got completed match, driver will assume
		connection can't be shutdown properly.
       Change:  Driver will teardown connection without cleaning up the commands
		when needed and it is the right thing to do.
       Impact:  None


   Bug fixes in other modules :
   --------------------------
	a) Cont00029590 - Linux iSCSI: Unable to connect to iSCSI target on a
				tagged vlan using offload iSCSI
		Fixed in cnic driver - vlan was not supported by the option-2
		  component of cnic driver. Code was added to support vlan tagging
		  and checking if the route to desitination is over a vlan interface.
		  cnic driver will set correct VLAN id while sending down option-2
		  connect request.
	b) Cont00029579 - Linux iSCSI:  Running ethtool -t with target connected
				causes kernel panic
		Fixed in bnx2 driver - Asynchronous reset during self-test causes
		  the cnic driver to crash.  The fix is to disallow offline selftest
		  when cnic driver is loaded.


Version 1.0.02 (May 22, 2007)
=============================
  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00029425 - Linux iSCSI: Issue when connecting to 16+ LUNs
       Cause:  RQ buffers replenish code was commented out. By default iSCSI QP
		is created with 16 RQ buffers, so were we allowed to discover
		16 SCSI LUNs. For the 17th LUN firmware did not have RQ buffer
		to place sense data.
       Change:  cleaned up RQ buffer replenish code
       Impact:  can connect to > 16 LUNs and run I/Os

    2. Problem: Cont00029532 - Linux iSCSI: Running more than 64 outstanding I/Os
		on multiple LUNs w/ disktest has issues
       Cause:   iSCSI initiator was not properly honoring the iSCSI Session Command
		window presented by the target. Netapp is actually only providing
		command window of 64 and once violated would drop the connection
		via' REJECT and ASYNC messages.
       Change:  iSCSI driver is taking care of iSCSI command window correctly

    3. Issues fixed in other modules -
	a) Cont00029404 - Linux iSCSI: Unable to login to Cisco MDS 9216
		Fixed in chip software (MIPS firmware) - Wrong KCQE opcode was
		due an error in error reporting mechanism. New FW version 3.7.1.A0
		fixes this.

	b) Cont00029415 - Linux iSCSI: HP target rejects NOP Out from our driver
		Fixed in chip software (MIPS firmware) - The correct opcode is
		sent to the wire now. Fixed in ver 3.7.1.A1

	c) Cont00029542 - Linux iSCSI: Problem formatting Stringbean target
		with ext3 file system
		Fixed in chip software (MIPS firmware) - The problem was present
		due to wrong error reporting mechanism in FW. This mechanism is
		fixed in new FW version 3.7.1.A0 

	d) Cont00029571 - Linux iSCSI:  Adding new session causes previous session
			to be dropped on Equallogic
		Fixed in chip software (MIPS firmware) - Wrong cam index handling
		caused the wrong connection to be flushed away from cam while
		removing other coonnection

	e) Cont00029579 - Linux iSCSI:  Running ethtool -t with target connected
			causes kernel panic
		Fixed in bnx2 driver - Asynchronous reset during self-test causes
		the cnic driver to crash.  The fix is to disallow offline selftest
		when cnic driver is loaded.

	f) Cont00029634 - Linux iSCSI:  Changing MTU size w/ drivers loaded causes
			kernel panic
		Fixed in bnx2 driver - For now, the bnx2 driver will not permit
		MTU changes after CNIC is loaded.  To change the MTU, you need
		to do so before loading the cnic driver. A better method will
		be available in future versions.

	g) Cont00029366 - Linux iSCSI: Unable to connect to EMC AX100SCi
		Fixed in chip software (MIPS firmware) - The bug is due to
		target TCP protocol vioaltion (not our bug actually).
		Now once we support window scale option - this issue is resolved. 
		

  Enhancements
  ============
	Implemented bnx2i driver maintained iSCSI statistics (Cont00029583).
	Some of the statistics counters are to be implemented by MIPS firmware
	and the interface specification. Once those are in place Cont00029583
	will be resolved. Also default value of HC_COMP_PROD_TRIP is changed
	from 0x00020004 to 0x00020008 to boost 2 port performance


Version 1.0.01 (May 08, 2007)
=============================
  Fixes
  =====
    1. Problem: Cont00029362 - Linux iSCSI: Proactive NOP Out not handled
		by the driver
       Cause:  'CmdSN' was not specified in nopout SQ WQE and was always
		accompanied with cmdsn value of 0x0000000. Also NOPIN received
		in response to Initiator's proactive NOPOUT was not propogated
		to open-iscsi user daemon.
       Change:  correct 'cmdsn' is used while posting NOPOUT request to ship and
		also code was added to send nopout pdu header to user daemon
       Impact: NA

    2. Problem: Cont00029416 - Linux iSCSI: Login/logout stress causes kernel panic
       Cause:   System crashed because of an issue in KCQ processing code in
		the CNIC driver
       Change:  Refer to CNIC driver's release notes for further information

  Enhancements
  ============
	None.


Version 1.0.00 (April 27, 2007)
===============================

   Initial release to QA team.

   This release will support most iSCSI full feature operations including 
	1. SCSI CMD, TMF, NOPIN, NOPOUT, ASYNC and LOGOUT
	2. REJECT is currently not supported
	3. All IO size from 512B to 512KB

   Driver unload and reload is also supported. This driver will work on Linux
Kernel 2.6.18 and 2.6.19 and open-iscsi software 2.0-724 or later is required
to make connections to iSCSI targets. iSCSI target discovery using 'SendTargets'
is the only one tested so far, but it should matter to bnx2i as complete
discovery is handled by the open-iscsi user code.

   Following targets were used during initial debugging stages and should be
fully supported -
	1. Equallogic PeerStorage PS100E
	2. Netapp Target - FAS250, FAS270
	3. Linux Software Target - iET
	4. Microsoft's StringBean target, minimal validation by developers
