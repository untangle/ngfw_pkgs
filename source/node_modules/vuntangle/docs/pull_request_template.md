Pull Request checklist:

- [ ] Did you name your branch and commits in the right format?
- [ ] Did you merge the master branch before creating this PR?
- [ ] Did you bump vuntangle version in package.json?
- [ ] Did you test your work with a full build of both ETM + MFW and tested all the lines you changed?
- [ ] Did you explicitly import all vuetify components you used?
- [ ] Did you use vuntangle translations by using this.$vuntangle.$t()?
- [ ] Did you make sure NOT to use dependencies like routes, store, or anything from the host app?
- [ ] Did you use async/await only when you needed it?  Did you use async/await in parallel instead of sequentially?
- [ ] Did you make sure to DRY your code?  Were you able to refactor existing code for reuse instead of making similar code?
- [ ] Did you break your code into smaller methods or components that each have a clear, singular responsibility, and could possibly be reused?
- [ ] Did you reduce the nesting level in your code, so it is not more than three levels nested in a method?  Did you return early to reduce nesting?
- [ ] Did you add comments so for instance a new developer would understand this code, and understand any business logic?
